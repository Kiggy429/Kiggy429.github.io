   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><center>So a lot of people have asked about my name Origin, and honestly it is common knowledge for a lot of people nowadays. Though let's go over the Origin of my name, full story.<br />
  So when I was playing Resident Evil 5, which released back in 2009 I had a pretty close group of friends who played it with me. I was 18 years old. I believe the oldest in the group actually.<br />
  One day while playing it and joking around I accidentally said Albert Weker. So the youngest in our group, she was like 11. Thought it was funny so started taking letters out of my name which is Klint.<br />
  Klint eventually evolved to Kit, which then eventually evolved to Kitty. So she called me Kitty for awhile, well our other smartass friend said I was more like a Piggy than a Kitty cause I ate a lot while gaming.<BR />
 It wasn't an insult, it was a joke and somewhat serious. I never ate meals I snacked all day, so I was always eating kinda deal. Anyways that spawned the whole Kitty+Piggy. Kiggy literally means Kitty+Piggy. So a cat pig hybrid.<br />
<br />
<br />
About a few years later, I changed my gamertag on xbox. I use it or a version of it in every single thing I use nowadays. It is my name. Not just a gamertag but a nickname.<br />
So when I made my steam tag on pc, I couldn't make it Kiggy as it was "taken" (how? why?) so I did the simple me thing.<br />
429 is April 29th, which is my birthday. A lot don't put this together here until later but my birthday literally is in my name. haha<br />
<br />
 So even my nickname was spawned off of my love for Resident Evil indirectly. And now thanks to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/churro_arts" target="_blank">Churro_Arts</a>, I also have a persona of what Kiggy looks like! Which didn't come around until I became a streamer. So very recent.</center></td>

   <td style="font-size:30px"><center>Personally About Me</center></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><center>I was born April 29th, 1991. I owe my love for games to my aunt and mother. When I was a very young kid, my aunt would play Super Mario Brothers 1 on our NES.<br />
    She showed me that she was controlling it, and I grabbed the NES Controller. I kept running Mario into the ditch, wasn't the best gamer at that young of an age.<br />
    My first game I remember getting myself was Pokemon Yellow Edition, so I have a lot of memories of Pokemon growing up.<br />
    Around the age of thirteen is when I got into Resident Evil series, I've played, seen or own every single game in the franchise. Only missing Resident evil Survivors and Gaiden. Though I have played Gaiden.<br />
    I literally bought my 3ds for Resident Evil Revelations 1.<br /><br />
    
    I am legally diagnosed with depression, a mood behavior disorder, and insomnia. Honestly I think I have more than just that but nothing else really is official so I leave it at this.<br />
    I am also an introvert, who rarely leaves the house unless its necessary. I get anxiety just being in a voice chat with more than like 3 people, and that's if I know all 3 people.<br />
    If I talk to you on voice chat freely, I am extremely comfortable with you because I usually don't. If you can text me, it's likely to get a faster response and more detailed response.<br /><br />
    
    While this is a hobby (content creation) it is also my only source of any kind of income I personally make. I don't need the income to live,<br >
    I am very lucky in that manner but it's nice having an income where I can actually do things I want to. Whether that be helping a friend, getting a new game, or just subscribing to my favorite streamers.<br />
    I say all this because I am asked by those that don't know me, what I do for a living and well this is it. I have always been unemployed.<br />
    This or that reason which is more or less personal, some of it. So don't feel sorry for me or such, but I'm honest.<br />
    My biggest supporter in all of this content creation has been my mother. A lot of what I use today was gotten from her.<br /><br />
    
    Due to my wide range on loved games, I am a variety streamer. I usually play rpg, horror, or story heavy based games. Though I honestly play whatever I enjoy.<br />
    Usually I'll play a game to it's story end, but for example when Resident Evil 4 remake came out. I played it on all difficulties pretty much on stream. So it varies.<br />
    Though pretty much if I can play it on Xbox Series X or Playstation 5, it's not sports related, and single player. I'll likely be interested to play it on stream.<br />
    I don't play competitive games or sports games. Though some people *cough*<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/unapologeticallysamtv" target="_blank">Sam</a>*cough* has gotten me to play Fortnite, and Overwatch 2. Otherwise, I've probably played at least one game in its genre.<br /><br />
    
    My Favorite Game: Resident Evil 2 (OG, though the remake is very much appreciated)</center></td>
