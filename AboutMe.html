   <td><center>So a lot of people have asked about my name Origin, and honestly it is common knowledge for a lot of people nowadays. Though let's go over the Origin of my name, full story.<br />
  So when I was playing Resident Evil 5, which released back in 2009 I had a pretty close group of friends who played it with me. I was 18 years old. I believe the oldest in the group actually.<br />
  One day while playing it and joking around I accidentally said Albert Weker. So the youngest in our group, she was like 11. Thought it was funny so started taking letters out of my name which is Klint.<br />
  Klint eventually evolved to Kit, which then eventually evolved to Kitty. So she called me Kitty for awhile, well our other smartass friend said I was more like a Piggy than a Kitty cause I ate a lot while gaming.<BR />
 It wasn't an insult, it was a joke and somewhat serious. I never ate meals I snacked all day, so I was always eating kinda deal. Anyways that spawned the whole Kitty+Piggy. Kiggy literally means Kitty+Piggy. So a cat pig hybrid.<br />
<br />
<br />
About a few years later, I changed my gamertag on xbox. I use it or a version of it in every single thing I use nowadays. It is my name. Not just a gamertag but a nickname.<br />
So when I made my steam tag on pc, I couldn't make it Kiggy as it was "taken" (how? why?) so I did the simple me thing.<br />
429 is April 29th, which is my birthday. A lot don't put this together here until later but my birthday literally is in my name. haha<br />
<br />
 So even my nickname was spawned off of my love for Resident Evil indirectly. And now thanks to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/churro_arts" target="_blank">Churro_Arts</a>, I also have a persona of what Kiggy looks like! Which didn't come around until I became a streamer. So very recent.</center></td>
