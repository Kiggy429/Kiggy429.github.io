   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><center>So a lot of people have asked about my name Origin, and honestly it is common knowledge for a lot of people nowadays. Though let's go over the Origin of my name, full story.<br />
  So when I was playing Resident Evil 5, which released back in 2009 I had a pretty close group of friends who played it with me. I was 18 years old. I believe the oldest in the group actually.<br />
  One day while playing it and joking around I accidentally said Albert Weker. So the youngest in our group, she was like 11. Thought it was funny so started taking letters out of my name which is Klint.<br />
  Klint eventually evolved to Kit, which then eventually evolved to Kitty. So she called me Kitty for awhile, well our other smartass friend said I was more like a Piggy than a Kitty cause I ate a lot while gaming.<BR />
 It wasn't an insult, it was a joke and somewhat serious. I never ate meals I snacked all day, so I was always eating kinda deal. Anyways that spawned the whole Kitty+Piggy. Kiggy literally means Kitty+Piggy. So a cat pig hybrid.<br />
<br />
<br />
About a few years later, I changed my gamertag on xbox. I use it or a version of it in every single thing I use nowadays. It is my name. Not just a gamertag but a nickname.<br />
So when I made my steam tag on pc, I couldn't make it Kiggy as it was "taken" (how? why?) so I did the simple me thing.<br />
429 is April 29th, which is my birthday. A lot don't put this together here until later but my birthday literally is in my name. haha<br />
<br />
 So even my nickname was spawned off of my love for Resident Evil indirectly. And now thanks to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/churro_arts" target="_blank">Churro_Arts</a>, I also have a persona of what Kiggy looks like! Which didn't come around until I became a streamer. So very recent.</center></td>

   <td style="font-size:30px"><center>Personally About Me</center></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><center>I was born April 29th, 1991. I owe my love for games to my aunt and mother. When I was a very young kid, my aunt would play Super Mario Brothers 1 on our NES.<br />
    She showed me that she was controlling it, and I grabbed the NES Controller. I kept running Mario into the ditch, wasn't the best gamer at that young of an age.<br />
    My first game I remember getting myself was Pokemon Yellow Edition, so I have a lot of memories of Pokemon growing up.<br />
    Around the age of thirteen is when I got into Resident Evil series, I've played, seen or own every single game in the franchise. Only missing Resident evil Survivors and Gaiden. Though I have played Gaiden.<br />
    I literally bought my 3ds for Resident Evil Revelations 1.<br /><br />
    
    I am legally diagnosed with depression, a mood behavior disorder, and insomnia. Honestly I think I have more than just that but nothing else really is official so I leave it at this.<br />
    I am also an introvert, who rarely leaves the house unless its necessary. I get anxiety just being in a voice chat with more than like 3 people, and that's if I know all 3 people.<br />
    If I talk to you on voice chat freely, I am extremely comfortable with you because I usually don't. If you can text me, it's likely to get a faster response and more detailed response.<br /><br />
    
    While this is a hobby (content creation) it is also my only source of any kind of income I personally make. I don't need the income to live,<br >
    I am very lucky in that manner but it's nice having an income where I can actually do things I want to. Whether that be helping a friend, getting a new game, or just subscribing to my favorite streamers.<br />
    I say all this because I am asked by those that don't know me, what I do for a living and well this is it. I have always been unemployed.<br />
    This or that reason which is more or less personal, some of it. So don't feel sorry for me or such, but I'm honest.<br />
    My biggest supporter in all of this content creation has been my mother. A lot of what I use today was gotten from her.<br /><br />
    
    Due to my wide range on loved games, I am a variety streamer. I usually play rpg, horror, or story heavy based games. Though I honestly play whatever I enjoy.<br />
    Usually I'll play a game to it's story end, but for example when Resident Evil 4 remake came out. I played it on all difficulties pretty much on stream. So it varies.<br />
    Though pretty much if I can play it on Xbox Series X or Playstation 5, it's not sports related, and single player. I'll likely be interested to play it on stream.<br />
    I don't play competitive games or sports games. Though some people *cough*<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/unapologeticallysamtv" target="_blank">Sam</a>*cough* has gotten me to play Fortnite, and Overwatch 2. Otherwise, I've probably played at least one game in its genre.<br /><br />
    
    My Favorite Game: Resident Evil 2 (OG, though the remake is very much appreciated)</center></td>

What a lot of people don't know is that I started out in content creation on YouTube as text-commentary. Which people always ask what do I mean by that? I would edit the video and put text on the screen either with the thoughts I had at the time, or whatever. <br />
I recorded the gameplay with my Xbox One which at the time I could only record in 10 minute videos. (I later got a flashdrive to allow for 1 hour videos) I would then edit, and clip them all together into a 1 or 2 hour video usually. I did this because I didn't have internet to stream and wanted to get into content creation. <br />
I did this for months. This would involve recording for a few hours, moving the files to my phone, editing them and uploading them to YouTube from my phone. Then I used the shitty hotspot I had to edit the titles, and description on my very old laptop. This could take upwards of an extra like 8 hours on top of just the couple hours of gaming.<br />
Any of my old playthroughs are still live on YouTube, can see how I use to do things but nowadays my YouTube has two purposes. The first being it stores all my Twitch VODs, so every game I've ever played is still able to be seen if someone missed it live. The second? For full commentary playthroughs.<br />
I can now thanks to my playstation 5 have my 1 hour videos, also record my microphone. So I can do commentary playthroughs if I own the game on playstation. Xbox still doesn't let that. I don't have a pc or capture card able to do it yet any other way. I still edit videos on my phone and upload to YouTube that way. Just a lot less work than I use to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I finally got to streaming on Twitch I already had 61 followers due to the fact of how active I was in the twitch community and how some knew I wanted to be a streamer eventually. I made affiliate in just 7 streams thanks to some really good friends on <b>Jan 15th, 2022</b>.<br />
I would never have made it to affiliate so fast if it wasn't for <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ohmymochii" target="_blank">OhMyMochii</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/partyhardgames" target="_blank">PartyHardGames</a> having double raided me at least twice if not three times in those seven days. They are even founders in my channel. Whether they know it or not, I will always be so grateful to both of them.<br />
I also always saw <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jacksongames_" target="_blank">JacksonGames_</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/alextenshii" target="_blank">AlexTenshii</a> always lurking for me on my push to affiliate. Jackson is probably where half my followers came from originally.<br />
<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/jenlou95" target="_blank">JenLou95</a> also helped more than she probably knows. Because I'm a very introverted person, and only reason I even had the nerve to speak on stream was because I am Jen's mod and was in her VC a lot. Helped run the commands and watched over her chat while we played together. Essentially I owe her for the confidence to even use a headset. Jen was also one of the first people I was moderator for.<br />
I originally was going for affiliate just to have my one emote, just be done with it while I was with solid internet. Though I fell in love with doing it so put a lot more effort in it. I actually did my first 7 streams without a microphone. I responded in chat only.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to April of 2022. I had applied to Team WildFire not expecting to make it as I was very new and even still struggling with some days thinking I'm not that great of a content creator. I was accepted onto the team. I applied to it because I knew a lot of good people on the team. The team gave me a lot of good friendships, a chosen family.<br />
Doesn't matter whether the team is currently in a limbo, if someone left the team. If we interacted, you are teammates for life to me. WildFire was an amazing time and my first stream as WildFire was on April 29th, my first birthday I ever spent and made a big deal on it. Went like 18 hours. April 29th, 2023 I went 26 hours live straight. I'll probably spend every birthday with ya'll on Twitch.<br />
<br />
As time went on I did start using TikTok as well. Usually only little random glitches, or so on go here. It usually is unique content. I try to keep all my platforms unique but also me. So no matter what platform you go to, it is a part of me.<br />
<br />
<br /></center>
<b><u>My current setups as of July 16th, 2023.</u></b><br />
<b>YouTube:</b> I record 1 hour segments on my playstation 5's flashdrive. I then move it to my phone and edit it with YouCut which then gets uploaded to YouTube. Full Vocal Commentary.<br />
<b>Twitch:</b> I stream directly from my Playstation 5 or my Xbox Series X. I use a very old laptop to run my twitch bot from and have mod view up in a browser for chat. If my microphone is muted, my sound alerts do not play through stream but it's set up that if I do have it unmuted it's pretty audible. I also use my phone to listen to my stream with the Twitch app, I have one earbud in to hear if the audio skips or what not under my actual headset. So I hear myself on a stream delay. That was something that took a lot of getting use to. Especially when reading game files.<br />
<b>TikTok:</b> Usually a minute or two clips of a glitch from either of my two consoles. A random thing I found funny in the game. Whatever. Edited on my phone.<br />
<b>Other Equipment Mentioned:</b> My phone is a Galaxy S10+, I have the 512GB SD Card so I can store the videos easily on my phone. I have 2 Turtle Beach Headsets. (Recon 200, Gen 2, Wired) It works for all platforms, and battery lasts like 15-16 hours. Twitch Bot is Streamer.Bot. Video Editor is a free to use one for Mobile devices, YouCut - Video Editor.

   <td style="font-size:30px"><center>Empathy</center></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td><center>So something I don't often speak on until more recently is my empathy. As honestly I'm still learning how it even works, but I can feel strong emotions.<br />
    I've met more than one person in my life that the first thing was I was drawn to them as I felt they needed a hand. I have a lot of issues in my life in general, and at one point in my life I decided I wouldn't ever be happy.<br />
    So if I couldn't be happy, at least I could use my time to make sure others lives were happy. I was young when I thought this and it stuck for awhile with me. I lived to bring light to others.<br />
    Over the years I learned it was more than just gut feelings, I can't always control it or channel it. Though I sense things about people, their emotions. If they're genuine. If they are hurting. <br /><br />
    
    If a friend of mine is hurting, even a stranger. I can't just leave them hurting. Even if it means just poking them now and again. Letting them know they are not alone. Because I feel it. I'm not the kind of person that can just walk away from that.<br />
    So if you're my friend, and I've pestered you when you're low. Know it's cause I felt it, and knowing how hard it is to deal with pain alone. I just wanna see the smile in you again.<br />
    I also don't put time in anyone, anymore that I don't feel like they deserve it. So I'm not just pestering you to help, I care and know what pain feels like.<br /><br />
    
    An example of my empathy is I am a moderator for someone who does charity streams. One day they were doing one for mental health (an amazing cause and glad I was a part of it.), but everyone was giving stories of loss or whatever else.<br />
    I felt everyone's sadness, pain. It felt like I was being overcharged. Like I'm a battery that can only handle a 80% charge normally and with everyone around there that night I was getting a 400% charge. Pretty sure I went to sleep right after.<br />
    Being an empath is draining and hard to explain but I wouldn't change it for the world. It's part of me and I'm happy for it, it's given me many really good friends over the years.</center></td>

   <td style="font-size:30px"><center>The Darkside Of Me</center></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>
    <details>
      <summary><b>(Trigger Warning: Loss, Depression, Dark Thoughts)</b></summary>
    <center>I'm gonna first describe my depression a bit, how I personally feel about depression. The best way I can describe it, my own personal experiences with it. Though first listen to this song cause its relevant: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlHTCd3EOGE" target="_blank">No Hero (Venom) by JT Music</a><br />
    I have lived with depression probably as early as I was like 12 years old, I just didn't know what it was back then and over the years I've learned more about it. I struggled a lot some days.<br />
    I see depression not as something to cure, or get rid of. It's a part of me. A darker part, but a part of me and honestly if it was gone I dunno if I would be me.<br />
    Saying this I see it as the easiest way to describe to someone who doesn't deal with depression or unsure of what they think of their own as a Symbiote. As like Venom is to Eddie Brock.<br />
    The Song No Hero means a lot to me because while Venom is one of my favorite marvel if not THE favorite marvel character. It speaks to me on a level of depression too in the song.<br />
    <b>"I got a Darkness inside, and its talking to me."</b><br />
    Depression is a darkness that is inside you, and it talks to you constantly. Usually the bad or dark thoughts.<br />
    <b>"A face so ugly I hide but it longs to be free."</b><br />
    I wore a mask hiding my depression or real emotions for a long time. I didn't have it break until I was in my twenties.<br />
    <b>"Once I've brought it to light. I'll be gone underneath. Swallowed consumed. I am one with the beast."</b><br />
    When I first let depression out it consumed me. I wasn't too sure I was going to make it out to the light side. It was like 10 years of darkness released.<br />
    <b>"I know we've both walked paths, on which we don't belong,  and now I have no doubt. If I cast you out. I'll be left with half myself"<br />
    "I got a darkness inside and it's walking with me. I'm buckled up for the ride. With a hunger to feed. I don't want you to hide. If you long to be free. We're no hero tonight."<br />
    "We're the monster you need. Swallowed consumed. Venom running through me. I won't be, nor will you, only we. Now I look at the face in the mirror and see. Just how fearsome we are."</b><br />
    The more we deny depression as a flaw and fault the harder it hurts us. We're not defective, we're different. Unique. The more I pushed against depression like I was defective, the more I lost myself.<br />
    Depression is like in this case a symbiote. We work together. Use my experience, my sadness, my rage, whatever I have to be productive. It will be around, yes it will whisper and you'll be consumed somedays but in the end I learned to ignore it's whispering and it's a part of me.<br />
    I'm no saint. I can be an asshole. I can rude. I am far from the best friend, or person in this world but I know who I am. I have my quirks and I accept them, I channel them for the better.<br />
    I'm not always happy. There's many days I don't want to move or get out of bed but overall I've learned to live with the "symbiote" and adapt myself to it. To live happy.<br /><br />
    
    Not saying everyone will be the same. Everyone treats everything different but know no matter how it affects you. We all react differently to different things. We also need to learn, it's okay to ask for help.<br />
    Some days we just need someone to make very loud noises to send the symbiote back down. I know I've only gotten out of consumed darkness due to friends more than once. So it's why I always have a hand for those who need it.<br /><br />
    
    I could go into it more but I think you get the idea how I feel depression is, always at the back of my shoulder whispering to me but overall we've learned to work together. To be a better me. Now my story more or less.<br />
    I'm not gonna make this all be fully chronological order. Just details about my past and why I am who I am. Not everything, and while I am mostly an open book somethings of my life remain silent or only to those I trust.<br /><br />
    
    The first sign of any type of pain I ever felt was a kidney stone, when I was like the age of 12. At my current age, I've hit the double digits was getting like one every year for the longest time. Kidney stones run in the family.<br />
    I grew up not happy, but a spoiled kid. I wasn't punished. I got pretty much anything I wanted but I wore what I later found out was a mask. Never showing my true emotions or causing waves. I wore this mask until one day in my early twenties.<br />
    My grandmother was diagnosed with Leukemia and after a couple years (I think?) of fighting she was losing the battle, and I couldn't accept it. A couple weeks? before she passed away I had a kidney stone again. She couldn't even stay awake to call my mother to take me to the ER.<br />
    I had so much emotional pain built up from knowing I was going to lose someone in my life that I was close to, and the kidney stone's physical pain. I had the pain for a week before I passed the stone, and a week or two after as if I still had it. My mask shattered and unfortunately my mother got the brunt of everything.<br />
    Everything that had been bothering me for my entire life. I'm depressed. I have bad eyesight. I didn't care how angry I sounded or if what I said hurt. I don't even remember what all I said to her. Though it was the best decision I made.<br />
    I was lost after my grandmother's passing. I probably owe my life to my mother, not only was she about the only one that understood me once my mask was gone. I live on the fact that no one's life is worthless. That even if I feel suicidal, I wouldn't ever. Because I know my life, would spiral another's. I wouldn't release my pain, I would pass it along.<br />
    I was my grandmother's right hand man ever since the day my mother moved out of the house. I have never worked as I didn't need to if I was gonna go to college, and around when I was going to consider it and looking for it is when she was diagnosed. So my focus then was just helping her whenever I could. My mind was too focused on the cancer anyways to care about video game programming.<br />
    So when she passed away I not only felt the pain of loss, I couldn't put my mask on anymore, it hurt so much. Sitting in the living room on the computer, looking over to the chair she would sleep in. Remembering just a few days ago she was there. Now just memories. I am an introvert only time I left the house was with her really. So now I felt trapped in a place where all I could see is memories, reminders of my loss. All I could do is hide in gaming and honestly, not caring if I woke up from sleep, if I could even sleep.<br />
    I think that was the only time in my life I was the darkest I ever felt. The darkness took me and ruled me. I wanted to die. I wasn't living anymore, not sure I ever was up to that point. Surviving is all I did. My mother let me move in with her indefinitely until I could control my emotions and such. Change of scenery. We ended up moving states, away from Florida where I lived since I was like 5.<br />
    The morning that my grandmother left to the doctor, the day she passed. Everyone went to say good bye, visiting her, whatever else. I couldn't go. My mother says it was right of me to not go, that she wasn't there anymore. If memory serves she bled in her brain that day. She "died" before she reached the hospital really. Though almost everyone back then said I was wrong for not going. I still think about how I never truly said good bye to her. To this day and that will always haunt me. Even if I know it was the only reason I stayed sane. If I had seen her, I'm not sure I would be here today either. I wasn't as strong as I am today.<br />
    I loved my grandmother but I also struggle with the idea that her passing is the only reason I am happier in my life too. That emotional break in me is what led me to get help. I went to a therapist for over a year. Maybe 2 or 3? Just before Covid really. I want to be a better me. She lied about a lot of things to a lot of us. A lot of half truths or just straight up lies. She raised us to be dependant on her. Only my mother was the one to truly break free from that. If she was still here today I would probably still be wearing my mask, and hiding how blind I was, how hurt I was.<br /><br />
    
    I grew up wearing that mask, in an online and gaming life. I was home-schooled, never had friends my age in real life. The only real life human interaction I usually got was with my family. Which was a double edged sword. I'm an introvert, being around social settings tire me out but it's also lonely to essentially not have friends. Most friends didn't last longer than a year or two. Most didn't value the online friendship like I did. So was use to people leaving. It was easier to not get attached.<br />
    I chose to live at an early age in helping others. "If I can't be happy, at least I can make others happy." I even got tagged as the "Dr. Phil" of some of my friend group as most of them would come to me for advice. I didn't think I deserved it, I wasn't worth knowing. I wasn't worth happiness. If I had any kind of purpose it was to just help others. Not many friends I use to talk to have stuck around today back then.<br />
    I think the longest friendship I have to date is with someone I don't talk to often nowadays, but she is and will always be like a sister to me. I think it's over 12 years we've been friends. Stryker is my second longest friendship. So some days it's still hard for me to believe people want me as their friend for life. I am a friend for life as long as you don't backstab me.<br />
    Though I know those who read this and are my friends today will slap me for saying it but it's the darkness whispering that history will repeat itself. Which my friends are family to me, so to lose some of my current family would hurt me a lot. So it's a fear there and probably always be there.<br /><br />
    
    I have a really hard time to speak vocally on anything serious or close to home. I will happily answer most questions or subjects in text/DMs but don't ask me to go into details like I am here in text. It is a mental block for me. I can open my mouth but nothing comes out. Even if I want it to, when I would talk to my mother even in the same room it would be through text. It's a thing that over the last few years has been slowly getting better, but it's still very very hard for me.<br /><br />
    
    I'm an insomniac, I can't make myself sleep ever. My sleep is usually heavily tied to my emotions. The deeper in a dark mood the less I sleep. This usually ranges from me being awake 20 hours, and sleeping anyhwere from 2-8 hours in "my day." Though it can also be much worse. Up 24+ hours, sleep 1 hour and up another 24 hour and repeat. I have usually very little warning when I'm gonna have really bad hits of insomnia. So it's hard for me to make schedules or plans, a lot of the time it's me just staying up to meet the plans and I know sometimes I spread myself too thin doing it. Though it's also things that make me feel better? So it's a double edged sword sometimes.<br /><br />
    
    I'm legally diagnosed by a therapist that I have depression, insomnia and a mood behavior disorder (pretty much the generic way to say I have mood swings and they don't know why). It's taken me years to not hate myself. I wouldn't be surprised if I have other things undiagnosed.<br /><br /><br />
    
    
    <b>Summary/points of my madness:</b><br /></center>
    * So if I say I'll do something and forget or don't do it. It is likely I passed out from being tired, or genuinely forgot. It's a reason a lot of time when I say I'll do something, I do it then or I run the risk of forgetting. "Out of sight, out of mind." Not intentionally doing it. Remind me!<br />
    * If I don't message you in awhile? It doesn't mean I don't think of you or consider you the same level of friend. I lose track of time due to being awake over 2 days all the time. DM me, I promise the friendship hasn't changed. Half time I don't know the time of day or even the day. I associate the time with things I do, not the day itself.<br />
    * If I don't join a community night VC or such? It's because even if I wanna join, my introvert nature keeps me out of it. I get anxiety and nerves just thinking of being in a bigger VC. Even if I can be in a VC with each and everyone of the people in the VC in smaller groups. Though I do wish I could.<br />
    * I don't outwardly show my emotions even without the mask. So I may not always show my appreciation for our friendship, for gifts, or whatever else. Though know while I forget things, I also have many memories of things you probably don't even remember yourself. The reasons you're in my inner circles. Reasons that I consider you family.<br />
    * If I withdraw for a bit? I'm likely just having a depression day and/or introvert overcharge day. I have to take some days, as no matter how well I've learned to live with my depression sometimes it is overwhelming still.<br />
    * I'm an introvert, too much interactions can burn me out fast but I also don't dislike people. On the contrary, I love the people who I let in and honestly in my darker times it is good to just hang out with one of my friends in a game. Even if headsets are off, sometimes required.<br />
    * If it's something super serious, it may have to be taken to text over voice. I have a weird mental block speaking on serious subjects vocally. I can do it so much better and easier in text. It's gotten better but it's still there. All of the years wearing a mask, it's hardcoded in me.<br />
    * I struggle a lot with accepting that I am worth anything. So bare with me while I work on myself. Twitch communities I'm a part of helped a lot with this, more than they probably ever know but it's still a work in progress.<br />
