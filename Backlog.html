I thought it'd be an interesting thing to dive back into this at some point and name the soldiers after my twitch community. If I do this though, I'll likely make it a much bigger deal. Ask people who want to be in it, what their class should be and such.</td>

I never knew there was a sequel called Ghoul Patrol until years after it'd been impossible to find it. So when I saw this double pack on sale I had to get it. It's part of my childhood. Use to play it all the time with my aunt.</td>
