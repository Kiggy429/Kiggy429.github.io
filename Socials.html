  <td><center>My Twitch handle is Kiggy429_Gaming, I go by Kiggy429 in most circles but I decided my Twitch will be fully focused on gaming like me overall. <br />
    So I decided to just slap gaming on it and this way I can make all of my content creations handles the same for most part.<br />
    Which only one I didn't change/make anew when I started content creation was my Twitter. <br />
    I am a variety streamer that streams directly off of either my Xbox Series X or my Playstation 5. Depending on the game and where I bought it.<br />
    More Twitch information can be found on the <a href="/Twitch.html">Twitch</a> page.</center></td>

  <td><center>I started out on YouTube before I ever was a streamer, low quality, random stuff. Some full lengths no commentary let's plays.<br />
Now my YouTube consists of my Twitch VODs as well as some exclusive YouTube only playthroughs with commentary.<br />
So if I'm not feeling the best to stream, I likely will record for YouTube as it is less taxing on my energy.<br />
I'm currently in process of a FULL ff14 playthrough on there but more details can be found on the <a href="/YouTube.html">YouTube</a> page.</center></td>

  <td><center>I retweet things, I try to keep my updates both here and in discord. I'm probably most active on twitter than any other social media.<br />
I really enjoy just talking to fellow content creators, friends and seeing memes posted.<br />
So if you don't like to join a discord server, likely twitter is the best place to see any updates about me and my content.</center></td>

   <td><center>So my discord server is locked behind roles, anyone can join but if you do not answer me or I don't recognize who you are.<br />
 I will not give a role to anyone I don't know to some degree. So if you do join and don't say anything in the Welcome Center you can expect not to get access to the rest of the channels.<br />
 I do constantly update it and go through stuff. So sometimes it is pending updating on some channels or what not.<br />
 Overall, it's both my personal and content creation server but all my information will be there. So feel free to join if you can/want to!</center></td>

  I have some bigger gifts set up there that'd either make my life easier either for streaming or my YouTube Content.<br />
  Though I try not to promote it cause I'm still learning to accept gifts. It does tweet out about any gifts I get though.</center></td>
