  <td>My Twitch handle is Kiggy429_Gaming, I go by Kiggy429 in most circles but I decided my Twitch will be fully focused on gaming like me overall. So I decided to just slap gaming on it and this way I can make all of my content creations handles the same for most part. Which only one I didn't change/make anew when I started content creation was my Twitter. I am a variety streamer that streams directly off of either my Xbox Series X or my Playstation 5. Depending on the game and where I bought it. More Twitch information can be found on the <a href="/Twitch.html">Twitch</a> page.</td>

  <td>I started out on YouTube before I ever was a streamer, low quality, random stuff. Some full lengths no commentary let's plays. Now my YouTube consists of my Twitch VODs as well as some exclusive YouTube only playthroughs with commentary. So if I'm not feeling the best to stream, I likely will record for YouTube as it is less taxing on my energy. I'm currently in process of a FULL ff14 playthrough on there but more details can be found on the <a href="/YouTube.html">YouTube</a> page.</td>

 <tr>
  <td><a href="https://www.twitter.com/kiggy429" target="_blank">Twitter</a></td>
  <td>I retweet things, I try to keep my updates both here and in discord. I'm probably most active on twitter than any other social media. I really enjoy just talking to fellow content creators, friends and seeing memes posted. So if you don't like to join a discord server, likely twitter is the best place to see any updates about me and my content.</td>

  <td>I'm very inconsistent on TikTok but I do post usually offline content you won't see anywhere else. Playing dead by daylight and got a funny clip? TikTok! Saw something funny while playing my main character on FF14? TikTok! haha</td>

 <tr>
  <td><a href="https://discord.com/invite/MNhZfB4tBV" target="_blank">Discord</a></td>
  <td>So my discord server is locked behind roles, anyone can join but if you do not answer me or I don't recognize who you are. I will not give a role to anyone I don't know to some degree. So if you do join and don't say anything in the Welcome Center you can expect not to get access to the rest of the channels. I do constantly update it and go through stuff. So sometimes it is pending updating on some channels or what not. Overall, it's both my personal and content creation server but all my information will be there. So feel free to join if you can/want to!</td>
