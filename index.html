<a style="font-size:15px"><b>Sunday:</b></a> Record/Edit Day<br />
I have a movie night with a friend and otherwise I will likely start using Sunday to record for YouTube, edit any videos for TikTok or otherwise. Ideally I start getting stuff to post later on days I'm not live or doing things.<br /><br />

<a style="font-size:15px"><b>Monday:</b></a> Off/Moderator On Twitch/Publishing Day<br />
I mod for people on Monday, you won't find me on Twitch or otherwise but I may start making this a day that I publish stuff on YouTube.<br /><br />

<a style="font-size:15px"><b>Tuesday:</b></a> Twitch Streaming<br />
I go live on Twitch, Tuesday's nights (Central Time, USA), usually closer to 11pm or Midnight. (Midnight would officially be Wednesday.) I generally aim to go at least 6 hours, but end time is never really decided. I sometimes end early if I got plans the next day or if I finish a game at like 4-5 hours. I won't start another mid-stream.<br /><br />

<a style="font-size:15px"><b>Wednesday:</b></a> Off/Moderator On Twitch/Publishing Day<br />
I rest usually from stream and mod for others on Twitch. As an introvert streaming does take a lot more energy out of me than most probably understand. Though I love it. Another good candidate for upload days.<br /><br />

<a style="font-size:15px"><b>Thursday:</b></a> Twitch Streaming<br />
Just like Tuesday, I'm likely to go live at Twitch around 11pm-midnight (Central Time, USA). So sometimes I don't go live until officially Friday in my time zone. Just like Tuesday as well, I aim to go 6 hours minimum though we have gone as long as 10+ hours on a casual stream day.<br /><br />

<a style="font-size:15px"><b>Friday:</b></a> Off/Moderator On Twitch/Publishing Day<br />
Recovering from Thursday, and likely modding around Twitch or otherwise. Also another good candidate for uploads to YouTube or otherwise.<br /><br />

<a style="font-size:15px"><b>Saturday:</b></a> Off/Moderator On Twitch<br />
Nothing. I plan to take Saturday as my own day. I will still be around to mod on Twitch or such but this day will not focus on anything but me time.<br /><br />

<a style="font-size:15px"><b>Exceptions:</b></a><br />
I have insomnia and depression. I can't always control sleep or drops in moods. I'm not gonna make myself sick to be live or so on.<br />
A new game release, I may move a stream day to another day if I want to play the game on the actual launch. Like when Resident Evil 4 Remake released I played it back to back streams until I beat it.<br />
I don't want to burn out either and I think sometimes I do too much, too fast or put it in my head that I must do this or that. I hate how spotty I have been lately with streams. Though I'm learning my mental/physical health IS important.

<td><center>So this site will be very much under construction, pages being updated as I go but I wanted to launch it before my birthday.<br />
So hello all, I may make a 'NEWS/Blog' type page and just have this as a little welcome page though for now this will contain my NEWS stuff.<br />
<br />
I likely won't have the Twitch, YouTube, or TikTok page up and running before tonight. Though I aim to have the About Me and the Socials up.<br />
The Socials will start to be linked from my bot, my profiles and will get updated as I add other socials.<br />
<br />
I will over time slowly make this a better site with more images, more fancy stuff but I am currently coding this purely from my knowledge of HTML and CSS.<br />
That I learned when I was 14, I'll be 32 tomorrow. I'm rusty. So we're gonna just get the basic bones of the website going and modify as we go on.</center></td>
