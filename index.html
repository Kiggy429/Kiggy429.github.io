<td><center>So this site will be very much under construction, pages being updated as I go but I wanted to launch it before my birthday.<br />
So hello all, I may make a 'NEWS/Blog' type page and just have this as a little welcome page though for now this will contain my NEWS stuff.<br />
<br />
I likely won't have the Twitch, YouTube, or TikTok page up and running before tonight. Though I aim to have the About Me and the Socials up.<br />
The Socials will start to be linked from my bot, my profiles and will get updated as I add other socials.<br />
<br />
I will over time slowly make this a better site with more images, more fancy stuff but I am currently coding this purely from my knowledge of HTML and CSS.<br />
That I learned when I was 14, I'll be 32 tomorrow. I'm rusty. So we're gonna just get the basic bones of the website going and modify as we go on.</center></td>
